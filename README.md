This project aims to develop a machine learning model for disease prediction based on various health parameters. The model utilizes a dataset containing information about patients' health attributes and whether they have a particular disease or not. By analyzing this data and training a machine learning algorithm, the model can predict the likelihood of a person having the disease based on their health parameters.
